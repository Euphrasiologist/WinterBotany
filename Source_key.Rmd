Introduction

I am a strong believer in a top down approach when it comes to identification. The top down approach in this context means trying to compartmentalise hundreds of species into natural groups such as orders, families or genera. Not only does it allow you to not have to worry about species (for the moment), but it allows you to see evolutionary groups of plants more easily. When confronted with new species in other parts of the world, with luck they will be placed within your working framework.

This guide is not intended as a replacement to the guides that already exist but it can be viewed to supplement them. By its nature of only dealing with genera the keys are necessarily shorter and less complex, which is the idea of this guide. Where possible the terminology is minimised and only the major characters of use are mentioned. This key will have very little in it that is actually new, it will be a synthesis of what in the literature already exists. So for this I cannot take credit. I have relied heavily on the literature, in no particular order: Winter Botany by William Trelease (date?), The Vegetative Key to the British Flora by John Poland and Eric Clement (date?), Flora of the British Isles by Clive Stace (2012), Trees of Britain and Northern Europe by Alan Mitchell (1976), more recently Identification of trees and shrubs in winter using buds and twigs by Bernd Schulz (2018) and the Conifers Plant Crib at the BSBI (1998) by Peter Sell, http://bsbi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Conifers_Crib_3.pdf. As always, where I could, terminology was simplified, though a glossary will be provided at the end.

The key to broad sections is outlined below. As this is a winter botanical key, not all species will be in leaf. First thing to note is that I have separated out the conifers first, because I believe them to have such a distinct structure compared to flowering plants that it would be confusing to integrate them with the other keys. This is not the case for deciduous coniferous species, which have been included in the main keys. This is because when there are no leaves, it is difficult to tell that a deciduous conifer is not a flowering plant. These genera are *Larix*, *Gingko*, *Metasequoia* and *Taxodium*.

Prickles are acute outgrowth of the stem, spines are modified leaves and thorns are modified stems.


The key should cater for any woody plant you find in the winter in the UK, save a few rare hortal escapes (though many of these are also covered), whether you are at the top of a mountain or by the sea.

My interest was sparked in the winter of 2016, mostly because I was frustrated I knew nothing about twigs! I have been compiling this on and off since then.

# Keys

    4. Bark not corky, leaves only spined on young shoots ... Quercus ilex
5. Terminal bud cluster with long, narrow, persistent stipules ... Quercus cerris
6. Terminal bud cluster with without long, narrow, persistent stipules -> 7
    7. Leaves lobed with aristate teeth. Hairless except for tufts of orange stellate hairs in vein axils below. Petiole >2.5cm -> 9 
    8. Leaves not toothed with aristate teeth. hairs present or not, but not as above. Petiole <2.5cm -> 11
9. Leaves dull above, lobes < half way to midrib. Hair tufts inconspicuous ... Quercus rubra
10. Leaves shiny above, lobes > half way to midrib. Hair tufts obvious ... Quercus coccinea
    11. Petiole to 1cm. Leaves cordate with reflexed auricles at base. Dull dark green above. Hairless or simple hairs below ... Quercus robur
    12. Petiole >1cm. Leaves cuneate, auricles absent. Shiny dark green above. Hairs stellate below ... Quercus petraea
    
Glossary:
Stipules - small herbaceous organs at base of buds or petiole
Stellate - star shaped
Aristate - with an awn or bristle
Cordate - heart shaped, with base rounded
Auricules - small lobed appendage
Cuneate - tapered to a base
