["index.html", "Winter Botany in the British Isles Preface", " Winter Botany in the British Isles Max Brown 2019-11-03 Preface I am a strong believer in a top down approach when it comes to identification. In the context here, this means trying to compartmentalise hundreds of species into natural groups such as orders, families or genera. Not only does it allow you to not have to worry about species (for the moment), but it allows you to see evolutionary groups of plants more easily. When confronted with new species in other parts of the world, with luck they will be placed within your working knowlegde. This guide is not intended as a replacement to the guides that already exist but it can be viewed to supplement them. By its nature of only dealing with genera the keys are necessarily shorter and less complex, which is the idea of this guide. Where possible the terminology is minimised and only the major characters of use are mentioned. This key will have very little in it that is actually new, at least in its current form; it will be a synthesis of what in the literature already exists. So for this I cannot take credit. I have relied heavily on the literature, in no particular order: Winter Botany by William Trelease (date?), The Vegetative Key to the British Flora by John Poland and Eric Clement (date?), Flora of the British Isles by Clive Stace (2012), Trees of Britain and Northern Europe by Alan Mitchell (1976), more recently Identification of trees and shrubs in winter using buds and twigs by Bernd Schulz (2018) and the Conifers Plant Crib at the BSBI (1998) by Peter Sell, http://bsbi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/Conifers_Crib_3.pdf. As always, where I could, terminology was simplified, though a glossary will be provided at the end. The key to broad sections is outlined first as this is a winter botanical key, not all species will be in leaf. First thing to note is that I have separated out the conifers first, because I believe them to have such a distinct structure compared to flowering plants that it would be confusing to integrate them with the other keys. This is not the case for deciduous coniferous species however, which have been included in the main keys. When there are no leaves on a coniferous plant, it is difficult to tell that a deciduous conifer is not a flowering plant. Luckily, there are only four genera that fit into this category Larix, Gingko, Metasequoia and Taxodium. The key should cater for any woody plant you find in the winter in the UK, save a few rare hortal escapes (though many of these are also covered), whether you are at the top of a mountain or by the sea. My interest was sparked in the winter of 2016, mostly because I was frustrated I knew nothing about twigs! I have been compiling this on and off since then. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Many woody plants in (especially northern) temperate climates with seasonal weather shed their leaves in the colder months of the year. On the most recent years growth, leaves fall to reveal the twig beneath. It is these structures left behind after the leaves fall that are valuable in identification. The twig itself can vary in thickness, colour, growth pattern (straight or zig-zagged) and cross sectional shape of the twig (round, oval, square). Where the leaf falls a scar is left behind. The distribution of leaf scars on a twig (phyllotaxy) is of major importance. The presence of at least one leaf scar indicates where the node is on a twig. Leaf scars can be present in groups of three or more, in which case they are considered whorled. Secondly leaf scars can be paired, usually on opposite sides of the twig. Thirdly and most commonly, leaf scars are present singularly at a node.Leaf scars are characteristic in size, shape and the number and distribution of vascular bundles present within them. Above the leaf scar, a bud will be present which contains meristems that will continue next years growth. They are often surrounded by scales, the size, shape and number of which are often diagnostic. Buds can be multiple at one node either next to each other (collateral), or above one another (superposed). The presence or absence of an end or terminal bud is determined either by the absence of an obvious leaf scar or by its morphological difference to lateral buds. Terminal buds are usually larger, if present. Sometimes buds can appear to be different even on the lateral buds and this is usually associated with a difference between buds that will go on to produce flowers, and those that will continue vegetative growth. Twigs can have many and varied outgrowths on them. These vary from small, thin flexible outgrowths (hairs), which can be shaped simply, forked, tree-like, woolly, star-shaped and glandular to name a few. Hardened outgrowths of the stem are called prickles. In contrast, spines are modified leaves and therefore have a bud at the base of them (be careful, bud may be obscured!) and thorns are modified stems. Where there is only one species in the genus, or the key specifically arrives at a species, the species is indicated in parentheses. "],
